# HeiChips 2025 Tapeout

![heichips25.jpg](img/heichips25.jpg)

This repository contains the chip for the [HeiChips Summer School 2025](https://heichips.github.io/). It includes several designs created during the Hackathon all connected to a common eFPGA fabric in the center.
Thanks to FABulous, the user bitstream for the FPGA can be generated using the upstream yosys and nextpnr toolchain.

The chip is designed with open source EDA tools and the [IHP Open Source PDK](https://github.com/IHP-GmbH/IHP-Open-PDK).

> [!WARNING]
> This repository is a Work in Progress.

In this context, "programmable" signifies that the module is initialized with a set of instructions. These instructions are then executed by its internal state machine, enabling dynamic PWM behavior. This allows for modifications to the PWM characteristics over time. A practical application of this would be, for instance, creating a pulsing LED effect. | [Link](https://github.com/HeiChips/heichips25-tiny-wrapper) |

## Configuration of the FPGA Fabric

The eFPGA fabric can be configured using the SPI peripheral or the SPI controller, depending on the value of `fpga_mode`. If the SPI controller is selected, upon startup it will fetch the bitstream from slot 0 of the external SPI flash. Using the slot input and the trigger one can initiate a reconfiguration. If the SPI peripheral is selected it will wait for bitstream data on the SPI interface upon startup.

## Building User Designs for the eFPGA

To build a bitstream of a user design for the eFPGA, see [README.md](ip/fabric/user_designs/README.md) under `ip/fabric/user_design`.

## Building the Chip

### Prerequisites

> [!NOTE]
> Either clone the repo using the following command: 
>```console
>git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:FPGA-Research/heichips25-tapeout.git
>```
> or initialize the submodules if you cloned the repo without them:
>
>```console
> git submodule update --init --recursive .
>```



To clone the compatible PDK version, simply run `make clone-pdk`.

In the next step, install LibreLane by following the Nix-based installation instructions: https://librelane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/nix_installation/index.html

Afterwards you can enable a Nix shell by running `nix-shell`.

## Implementing the Tiles

```
cd ip/tile_library/; nix develop --command make all
```

## Implementing the Fabric

```
cd ip/fabric/; nix develop --command make fabric
```

### Running LibreLane

To build the chip with LibreLane:

```console
make librelane
```

To view the design in OpenROAD:

```console
make librelane-openroad
```

Or to view it in KLayout:

```console
make librelane-klayout
```

To render an image of the chip:

```
make render-image
```

And with this the chip is ready for tapeout. 

### Building the Bitstreams

To build the bitstream, install the fasm Python package:

```
pip3 install fasm
```

And run the following:

```
cd ip/fabric/user_designs/; nix shell nixpkgs#{yosys,nextpnr} --command make build_all
```

### Running Chip-Top Level Simulation

The cocotb testbench is located under `tb/heichips25_top/heichips25_top_tb.py`.

To run all chip-top level simulations, simply run:

```
make sim
```

You can run the gate-level tests after the chip has been implemented:

```
make sim-gl
```
